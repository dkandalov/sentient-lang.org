# JavaScript API

This section explains Sentient's JavaScript API. Sentient can be used in a
browser to compile and run Sentient programs and perform related operations.
The feature set provided by the JavaScript API is the same as the command-line
interface, but it does not support some features such as
[optimisation](../cli/optimise) and setting the [machine](../cli/machine).

The JavaScript API is available on this site via the developer console or you
can add it to your own web page by following
[these instructions](../tutorial/browser).
