# Command-line interface

This section explains Sentient's command-line interface. The CLI can be used to
compile, optimise and run Sentient programs on a command-line as opposed to in
a browser. The feature set provided by the CLI is the same as the JavaScript
API, but it additionally supports [optimisation](./optimise) and changing the
[machine](./machine).

If you haven't done so already, you can install the CLI by following [these
instructions](../tutorial/installation).
