# Running in a browser

Alternatively, you can run Sentient in a browser with this script tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/sentient-lang/0.0.0-alpha.41/sentient.js"></script>
```

Sentient is written in JavaScript and can be run anywhere that JavaScript runs.
The above script adds 'Sentient' as a global variable, which can be used for
compiling and running programs. Sentient is hosted on
[cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/about). You should check
[here](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/sentient-lang) to get the latest version.

For now, this guide will continue to use the command-line interface, but it's
useful to know that Sentient programs can be run anywhere!
