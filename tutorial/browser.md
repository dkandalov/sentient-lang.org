# Running in a browser

Alternatively, you can run Sentient in a browser with this script tag:

```html
<script src="https://sentient-lang.github.io/sentient-lang/bin/sentient.js"></script>
```

Sentient is written in JavaScript and can be run anywhere that JavaScript runs.
The above script adds `Sentient` as a global variable, which can be used for
compiling and running programs.

For now, this guide will continue to use the command-line tool, but it's useful
to know that Sentient programs can be run anywhere!
