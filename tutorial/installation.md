# Installing Sentient

If you're running Node, you can install Sentient with:

```bash
npm install -g sentient-lang
```

And that's it! That will install the 'sentient' executable which you can use for
compiling and running Sentient programs.

At present, Sentient is officially supported in **Node 0.11 or newer**, but it
will probably work with older versions, too. You can check which version of Node
you're running with:

```
node --version
```
