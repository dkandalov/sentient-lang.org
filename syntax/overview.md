# Language syntax

This section specifies the syntax of the Sentient programming language. It is
intended to be informative and brief. Sentient programs are comprised of
**statements** separated by semi-colons. Each type of statement is explained in
this section.

For a more thorough understanding of the Sentient language, please refer to the
documentation in the **Standard library** section as well as the **Examples**.
It is recommended that you read the [Getting started](../tutorial/introduction)
guide first, if you haven't already.
