# Lingeling

- **Author:** Armin Biere
- **Homepage:** [http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/)

The Lingeling solver has won [many competitions](http://www.satcompetition.org/)
and tends to be faster than the default [MiniSat](./minisat) solver. Its license
stipulates that it may not be used for commercial purposes. Sentient does not
ship with Lingeling and it must be installed separately.

If you are on a Mac, Sentient-Lang provides a
[homebrew formula](https://github.com/sentient-lang/homebrew-lingeling) for
Lingeling.
