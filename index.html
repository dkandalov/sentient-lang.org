<h1>Computer, here's my problem. Go figure.</h1>

<p>
The vast majority of programming languages used today are imperative. We
tell computers precisely how to solve problems and they slavishly obey.
We rely on the ingenuity of programmers to figure out how these problems
should be solved and to translate their ideas into code.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sentient</strong> takes a different approach.
</p>

<p>
Sentient is an experimental programming language that lets you describe
<em>what</em> your problem is and not <em>how</em> to solve it. Sentient
tries to figure that out for itself. To achieve this, a clear
description of a problem is required. Sentient provides a rich toolkit,
allowing programmers to express their problems in a familiar way.
</p>

<p>
Sentient is written in JavaScript and runs on a variety of platforms.
