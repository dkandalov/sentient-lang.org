<h1>Computer, here's my problem. Go figure.</h1>

<p>
The vast majority of programming languages used today are imperative. We
tell computers precisely what to do and they slavishly obey. We rely on the
ingenuity of programmers to come up with solutions and to translate their ideas
into code.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Sentient</strong> does things differently.
</p>

<p>
Sentient is an experimental programming language that lets you describe
<em>what</em> your problem is and not <em>how</em> to solve it. Sentient
tries to figure that out for itself. It provides a rich toolkit to allow
programmers to express their problems in a familiar way.
</p>

<p>
Under the hood, it uses state-of-the-art
<a href="http://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2016/">SAT solvers</a> to
rapidly find solutions. This is an active field that's constantly improving and
it means Sentient is decoupled from its solving processes. This enables Sentient
to focus on the difficult problem of reducing high-level abstractions, used in
modern programming languages, to SAT.
</p>

<p>
Sentient is written in JavaScript and is extremely portable. It can be used as a
standalone application or as a dependency of other libraries and utilities.
It can be extended to use different SAT solvers and supports a variety of
solvers right out of the box.
